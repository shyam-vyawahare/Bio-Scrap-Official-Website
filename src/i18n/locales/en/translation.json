        "question": "How does waste segregation help the environment?",
        "answer": "Proper waste segregation reduces landfill burden, enables effective recycling, prevents soil and water pollution, reduces greenhouse gas emissions from decomposing waste, and helps create valuable compost from organic waste. It's crucial for a sustainable future."
